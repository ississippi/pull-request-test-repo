# If you're a newbie and sometimes have a hard time understanding the logic. Don't worry, you'll catch up 
# after a month of doing Leetcode on a daily basis. Try to do it, even one example per day. It'd help. 
# I've compiled a bunch on sum problems here, go ahead and check it out. Also, I think focusing on a subject 
# and do 3-4 problems would help to get the idea behind solution since they mostly follow the same logic. 
# Of course there are other ways to solve each problems but I try to be as uniform as possible. Good luck.
# In general, sum problems can be categorized into two categories: 1) there is any array and 
# you add some numbers to get to (or close to) a target, or 2) you need to return indices of numbers 
# that sum up to a (or close to) a target value. Note that when the problem is looking for a indices, 
# sorting the array is probably NOT a good idea.
# Two Sum:
# This is the second type of the problems where we're looking for indices, so sorting is not necessary. 
# What you'd want to do is to go over the array, and try to find two integers that sum up to a target value. 
# Most of the times, in such a problem, using dictionary (hastable) helps. You try to keep track of you've 
# observations in a dictionary and use it once you get to the results.
# Note: try to be comfortable to use enumerate as it's sometime out of comfort zone for newbies. enumerate 
# comes handy in a lot of problems (I mean if you want to have a cleaner code of course). If I had to choose 
# three built in functions/methods that I wasn't comfortable with at the start and have found them super helpful, 
# I'd probably say enumerate, zip and set.
# Solution: In this problem, you initialize a dictionary (seen). This dictionary will 
# keep track of numbers (as key) and indices (as value). So, you go over your array (line #1) using enumerate 
# that gives you both index and value of elements in array. As an example, 
# let's do nums = [2,3,1] and target = 3. Let's say you're at index i = 0 and value = 2, ok? 
# you need to find value = 1 to finish the problem, meaning, target - 2 = 1. 1 here is the remaining. 
# Since remaining + value = target, you're done once you found it, right? So when going through the array, 
# you calculate the remaining and check to see whether remaining is in the seen dictionary (line #3). 
# If it is, you're done! you're current number and the remaining from seen would give you the output (line #4). 
# Otherwise, you add your current number to the dictionary (line #5) since it's going to be a 
# remaining for (probably) a number you'll see in the future assuming that there is at least one instance of answer.

class Solution1:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        seen = {}
        for i, value in enumerate(nums): #1
            remaining = target - nums[i] #2
            
            if remaining in seen: #3
                return [i, seen[remaining]]  #4
            else:
                seen[value] = i  #5
        print(seen)
# Two Sum II:
# Two Sum II:
# For this, you can do exactly as the previous. The only change I made below was to change the order of line #4. In the previous example, the order didn't matter. But, here the problem asks for asending order and since the values/indicess in seen has always lower indices than your current number, it should come first. Also, note that the problem says it's not zero based, meaning that indices don't start from zero, that's why I added 1 to both of them.

class Solution2:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        seen = {}
        for i, value in enumerate(numbers): 
            remaining = target - numbers[i] 
           
            if remaining in seen: 
                return [seen[remaining]+1, i+1]  #4
            else:
                seen[value] = i  

# Another approach to solve this problem (probably what Leetcode is looking for) is to treat it as 
# first category of problems. Since the array is already sorted, this works. 
# You see the following approach in a lot of problems. What you want to do is to have 
# two pointer (if it was 3sum, you'd need three pointers as you'll see in the future examples).
# One pointer move from left and one from right. Let's say you numbers = [1,3,6,9] and your target = 10. 
# Now, left points to 1 at first, and right points to 9. There are three possibilities.
# If you sum numbers that left and right are pointing at, you get temp_sum (line #1). If temp_sum is your target, 
# you'r done! You're return it (line #9). If it's more than your target, it means that right is 
# pointing to a very large value (line #5) and you need to bring it a little bit to the left 
# to a smaller (r maybe equal) value (line #6) by adding one to the index . If the temp_sum is 
# less than target (line #7), then you need to move your left to a little bit larger value by adding one to 
# the index (line #9). This way, you try to narrow down the range in which you're looking at and will eventually 
# find a couple of number that sum to target, then, you'll return this in line #9. In this problem, 
# ince it says there is only one solution, nothing extra is necessary. However, when a problem asks to 
# return all combinations that sum to target, you can't simply return the first instace and you need to 
# collect all the possibilities and return the list altogether (you'll see something like this in the next example).

class Solution3:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        for left in range(len(numbers) -1): #1
            right = len(numbers) - 1 #2
            while left < right: #3
                temp_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right] #4
                if temp_sum > target:  #5
                    right -= 1 #6
                elif temp_sum < target: #7
                    left +=1 #8
                else:
                    return [left+1, right+1] #9
# 3Sum
# This is similar to the previous example except that it's looking for three numbers. There are some minor differences in the problem statement. It's looking for all combinations (not just one) of solutions returned as a list. And second, it's looking for unique combination, repeatation is not allowed.
# Here, instead of looping (line #1) to len(nums) -1, we loop to len(nums) -2 since we're looking for three numbers. Since we're returning values, sort would be a good idea. Otherwise, if the nums is not sorted, you cannot reducing right pointer or increasing left pointer easily, makes sense?
# So, first you sort the array and define res = [] to collect your outputs. In line #2, we check wether two consecutive elements are equal or not because if they are, we don't want them (solutions need to be unique) and will skip to the next set of numbers. Also, there is an additional constrain in this line that i > 0. This is added to take care of cases like nums = [1,1,1] and target = 3. If we didn't have i > 0, then we'd skip the only correct solution and would return [] as our answer which is wrong (correct answer is [[1,1,1]].
# We define two additional pointers this time, left = i + 1 and right = len(nums) - 1. For example, if nums = [-2,-1,0,1,2], all the points in the case of i=1 are looking at: i at -1, left at 0 and right at 2. We then check temp variable similar to the previous example. There is only one change with respect to the previous example here between lines #5 and #10. If we have the temp = target, we obviously add this set to the res in line #5, right? However, we're not done yet. For a fixed i, we still need to check and see whether there are other combinations by just changing left and right pointers. That's what we are doing in lines #6, 7, 8. If we still have the condition of left < right and nums[left] and the number to the right of it are not the same, we move left one index to right (line #6). Similarly, if nums[right] and the value to left of it is not the same, we move right one index to left. This way for a fixed i, we get rid of repeative cases. For example, if nums = [-3, 1,1, 3,5] and target = 3, one we get the first [-3,1,5], left = 1, but, nums[2] is also 1 which we don't want the left variable to look at it simply because it'd again return [-3,1,5], right? So, we move left one index. Finally, if the repeating elements don't exists, lines #6 to #8 won't get activated. In this case we still need to move forward by adding 1 to left and extracting 1 from right (lines #9, 10).
class Solution4:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        
        nums.sort()
        res = []

        for i in range(len(nums) -2): #1
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]: #2
                continue
            left = i + 1 #3
            right = len(nums) - 1 #4
            
            while left < right:  
                temp = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
                                    
                if temp > 0:
                    right -= 1
                    
                elif temp < 0:
                    left += 1
                
                else:
                    res.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]]) #5
                    while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]: #6
                        left += 1
                    while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right-1]:#7
                        right -= 1    #8
                
                    right -= 1 #9 
                    left += 1 #10
                       
# Another way to solve this problem is to change it into a two sum problem. Instead of finding a+b+c = 0, you can find a+b = -c where we want to find two numbers a and b that are equal to -c, right? This is similar to the first problem. Remember if you wanted to use the exact same as the first code, it'd return indices and not numbers. Also, we need to re-arrage this problem in a way that we have nums and target. This code is not a good code and can be optimipized but you got the idea. For a better version of this, check this.

# 4Sum

# You should have gotten the idea, and what you've seen so far can be generalized to nSum. Here, I write the generic code using the same ideas as before. What I'll do is to break down each case to a 2Sum II problem, and solve them recursively using the approach in 2Sum II example above.

# First sort nums, then I'm using two extra functions, helper and twoSum. The twoSum is similar to the 2sum II example with some modifications. It doesn't return the first instance of results, it check every possible combinations and return all of them now. Basically, now it's more similar to the 3Sum solution. Understanding this function shouldn't be difficult as it's very similar to 3Sum. As for helper function, it first tries to check for cases that don't work (line #1). And later, if the N we need to sum to get to a target is 2 (line #2), then runs the twoSum function. For the more than two numbers, it recursively breaks them down to two sum (line #3). There are some cases like line #4 that we don't need to proceed with the algorithm anymore and we can break. These cases include if multiplying the lowest number in the list by N is more than target. Since its sorted array, if this happens, we can't find any result. Also, if the largest array (nums[-1]) multiplied by N would be less than target, we can't find any solution. So, break.

# For other cases, we run the helper function again with new inputs, and we keep doing it until we get to N=2 in which we use twoSum function, and add the results to get the final output.

# Combination Sum II
# I don't post combination sum here since it's basically this problem a little bit easier.
# Combination questions can be solved with dfs most of the time. if you want to fully understand this concept and backtracking, try to finish this post and do all the examples.

# Read my older post first here. This should give you a better idea of what's going on. The solution here also follow the exact same format except for some minor changes. I first made a minor change in the dfs function where it doesn't need the index parameter anymore. This is taken care of by candidates[i+1:] in line #3. Note that we had candidates here in the previous post.

class Solution7(object):
    def combinationSum2(self, candidates, target):
        """
        :type candidates: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[List[int]]

        res = []
        candidates.sort()

        return res
    
    
    def dfs(self, candidates, target, path, res):

                continue #2
            self.dfs(candidates[i+1:], target - candidates[i], path+[candidates[i]], res) #3
# The only differences are lines #1, 2, 3. The difference in problem statement in this one and combinations problem of my previous post is >>>candidates must be used once<<< and lines #1 and 2 are here to take care of this. Line #1 has two components where first i > 0 and second candidates[i] == candidates[i-1]. The second component candidates[i] == candidates[i-1] is to take care of duplicates in the candidates variable as was instructed in the problem statement. Basically, if the next number in candidates is the same as the previous one, it means that it has already been taken care of, so continue. The first component takes care of cases like an input candidates = [1] with target = 1 (try to remove this component and submit your solution. You'll see what I mean). The rest is similar to the previous post
